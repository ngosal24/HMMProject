# In this project we:

▪ Began by organizing and cleaning our train/testdata to make it useable for the Hidden Markov Model.

▪ Performed a PCA on the variables to determine which of them have the most importance in terms of determining whether or not it is an anomaly.

▪ Created multiple Hidden Markov Models to find the best one (according to number of states) for anomaly detection by training and testing them. We determined this using two metrics, BIC and Log-Likelihood.

▪ Used our determined model on datasets with injected anomalies to judge its performance.



All code has been organized into one script with sections and commentary. Final report is attached in a seperate file.
