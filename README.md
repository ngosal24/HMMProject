# In this project I:

▪ Developed and trained a number of Hidden Markov Models with household electrical consumption data to establish knowledge of normal behaviour \n
▪ Tested said model to detect anomalies in unseen data and evaluated using log-likelihood scores to determine the best performing model
▪ Completed and presented with a four-member team, with visualizations and information that would be applicable to stakeholders
