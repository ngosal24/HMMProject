# In this project we:

▪ Developed and trained a number of Hidden Markov Models with household electrical consumption data to establish knowledge of normal behaviour

▪ Tested said model to detect anomalies in unseen data and evaluated using log-likelihood scores to determine the best performing model

▪ Completed and presented with a four-member team, with visualizations and information that would be applicable to stakeholders


All code has been organized into one script with sections and commentary. Final report is attached in a seperate file.
